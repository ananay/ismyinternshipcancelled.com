# 🤔  Is My Internship Cancelled?

The official website source code of [ismyinternshipcancelled.com](https://ismyinternshipcancelled.com) because you have a lot to see, and we have nothing to hide. Made using GatsbyJS which is basically a static React site generator.


## ℹ  Data Source
We don't have a backend (yet) because we don't need it for now. We're using Google Sheets to host it. Isn't that cool?
